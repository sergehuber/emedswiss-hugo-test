this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on
by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to
listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined
to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on
the part of the public. This gleam of hope acquired fresh life, when he
saw Quasimodo, Coppenole, and the deafening escort of the pope of the
procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar. The throng rushed
eagerly after them. “Good,” he said to himself, “there go all the
mischief-makers.” Unfortunately, all the mischief-makers constituted the
entire audience. In the twinkling of an eye, the grand hall was empty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter V: Quasimodo</title><link>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:15:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion. It was settled that each candidate, man or woman (for it was possible to choose a female pope), should, for the sake of leaving the impression of his grimace fresh and complete, cover his face and remain concealed in the chapel until the moment of his appearance. In less than an instant, the chapel was crowded with competitors, upon whom the door was then closed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter IV: Master Jacques Coppenole</title><link>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 11:14:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low
bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a
large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter
abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by
the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the
velvet and silk which surrounded him. Presuming that he was some groom who
had stolen in, the usher stopped him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter III: Monsieur the Cardinal</title><link>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 11:13:32 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean,
the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that
famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris,
on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians
at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the
Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic
moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His
eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter II: Pierre Gringoire</title><link>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2017 11:00:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration
unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when
he reached that untoward conclusion: “As soon as his illustrious eminence,
the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,” his voice was drowned in a thunder
of hooting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked the
people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was
audible, piercing the uproar like the fife’s derisive serenade: “Commence
instantly!” yelped the scholar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chapter I: The Grand Hall</title><link>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:58:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/post/chapter-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago
to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple
circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has
preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus
set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.
It was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt
led along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor
an entry of “our much dread lord, monsieur the king,” nor even a pretty
hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris. Neither was it
the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and
bedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that
nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the
marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its
entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon,
who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an
amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and
to regale them at his Hôtel de Bourbon, with a very “pretty morality,
allegorical satire, and farce,” while a driving rain drenched the
magnificent tapestries at his door.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/about/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://sergehuber.github.io/emedswiss-hugo-test/images/Victor_Hugo-Hunchback.jpg">&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>&lt;em>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&lt;/em> (French: &lt;em>Notre-Dame de Paris&lt;/em>) is a French Romantic/Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The original French title refers to Notre Dame Cathedral, on which the story is centered. English translator Frederic Shoberl named the novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1833 because at the time, Gothic novels were more popular than Romance novels in England. The story is set in Paris, France in the Late Middle Ages, during the reign of Louis XI.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
